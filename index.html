            <h1> Problem:</h1>
            <p>Sea Turtles are endangered and itâ€™s difficult to know how to help.
                <br> People are not always sure how to get involved and websites do 
                <br> not always offer clear realistic actions.
            </p>
            <h1> Solution:</h1>
            <p>We believe that a beautifully designed website about Saving the
                <br> Sea Turtles with clear calls to action will give people a cause to
                <br> become involved in! Make it easy to

              <h2>User Research </h2>
              <h1> User Interviews and Survey </h1>
              <p>4 User Interviews were conducted along with a survey that gave us data about how people might engage 
                  <br> with this type of a website. We found that people wanted lots of options on how to engage 
                  <br> and a more inspiring design.
              </p>
              
              <h1> User Research-Sticky Notes and Affinity Diagram </h1>
              <p> After having the user interviews, I made an Affinity Diagram which helps gather large amount of
                 <br> data and organise them into groups of similar categories. This is a small snippit of the
                 <br>process.

              <br>Helping to save the Sea Turtles is a perfect way to do this. I believe that by helping redesign a local non-profit
              <br>(Sea Turtle Conservancy) for helping Sea Turtles, adding in more clear calls to actions, & making a more inspiring & clear
              <br>website. People will be able to plug in & help with this cause in a best way suited for them.
              </p>
              <h1> Value Proposition </h1>
              <p>Sea Turtle Conservancy makes it easy for you to help Save the Sea Turtles! You can donate money or time, adopt a turtle, or 
              <br>educate yourself, so you can educate others, and even raise awareness on social media!</p>
